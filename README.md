Hi, my name is **Sonia**. :wave: I am a _1st year MURP student_ concentrating in _transportation_. I recentely moved here from Washington, D.C. 


The purpose of this course is to teach how to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.
Some of my project topic ideas are about aerial transit :mountain_cableway:, domestic climate migration, and pedestrianism and walkability. :foot: 


My objectives of the couse are to have a complete project that I can point to , as well as feel comfortable with the basics of GIS :world_map: and Python :snake:,
and to find a way to advance these two skills in this program and beyond in ways that I find interesting.
